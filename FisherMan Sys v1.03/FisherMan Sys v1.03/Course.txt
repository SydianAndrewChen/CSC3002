Course Title: 'Internal Auditing and Risk Management
Course Unit: 3
Course Description: Internal auditing can be described as a management-oriented discipline which has evolved rapidly. Such evolution is partially attributable to the emergence of corporate governance after a series of corporate scandals. A robust corporate governance regime within an organisation assists how the organisation operates and how business and strategic objectives can be attained. To achieve such objectives, management needs to properly identify and manage a number of risks which may adversely affect the organisation’s success. This is the reason why risk management forms a cornerstone for corporate governance. The next question will be how risk management strategies can be executed. This then brings the significance of internal control activities to light. There is therefore an inter-locking relationship between corporate governance, risk management and internal control activities. This course attempts to investigate these three areas and highlight how internal auditing can bring values to an organisation in the abovementioned aspects. The course is divided into three main blocks: (i) corporate and board governance under the requirements of the Hong Kong Listing Rules; (ii) risk identification, assessment and management techniques from the perspectives of internal auditors; and (iii) compliance risk management with a discussion of the current business issues such as forensic investigons, anti-bribery programmes and anti-money laundering techniques.

Course Description: EBP is the first in a series of four courses that improve student ability to read, write, listen, and speak in English. Our goal is to communicate effectively and with confidence in professional English (as opposed to academic English). To accomplish this, we will study English in a systematic way through an integrated series of assignments linking reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The assignments progress from simple to more complex, adding skills and building on what students learn. We will cover sentence-level grammar, the writing process, paragraph and paper organization, points of writing style, reading skills, listening skills, and public speaking skills (including the use of graphics and presentations). Using our textbook as a blueprint, students will progress through a series of increasingly complex listening and reading assignments. These are supplemented with specific exercises targeting common sentence-level grammar needs. In addition, we are integrating listening, writing, and speaking into our discussion of the textbook material. Students will write (and present to their classmates) one LISTENING summary and/or response, and one READING summary and/or response. Students will also work in teams to present and exemplify the basic points of each unit in the textbook to their classmates.

Course Title: Rethinking Social Scinece Historically
Course Unit: 3
Course Description: Social science is expected to establish universal explanations of society, but social scientists hold contesting theories. Radical critics even argue that there is no objectivity in social science. Neither can there be a consensus on how to identify the family of social science. To a large extent, the cross-disciplinary diversity is the historical consequence of institutionalisation and professionalisation for centuries. This course, from a transnational perspective, sheds light on the historical development of social science from the Enlightenment to the present. We are going to: (1) discuss influential theorists such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Thomas Kuhn; (2) assess their legacies that constantly transcend national borders; (3) conceptualise the institutionalisation and professionalisation; (4) look into the state’s intervention. In short, it is an introduction to social science in global history. It is also a self-reflexive course, aiming to reveal the long ignored relationship between history and social science in our time.

We will survey a broad range of topics of contemporary interest, such as gender, markets, media, tourism and globalization. Through these topics students will acquire an understanding of the commitments and sensibilities that inform contemporary socio-cultural anthropology. The underlying perspective the course adopts, and which the myriad materials point to, is the dynamic relation between cultural diversity and human nature. Accordingly, the course will give significant attention to fundamental philosophical and ethical questions in the human sciences. Is there an underlying human nature shared by all, for example, are human beings primarily driven by self-interest and self-maximisation? Is it ethical for one culture to intervene in the affairs of another culture?

Course Title: Families and Modernities
Course Unit: 3
Course Description: Who is “family”? What is “modernity”? Ideas of family and modernity continue to  inform how communities think about themselves and the world. Contrary to expectation, kinship did not disappear with the advent and advancement of modernity. Nations and citizens, corporations and employees, gamers and hackers and many others continue to conceive of social relations in the idiom of kinship at least at times – while the converse is also true, that is, the ideas of modernity have intertwined with those of the family, identity, locality and belonging. Putatively, kin-based organization is based on identification to and loyalty to specific persons and lineages, whereas bureaucratic organization is based on loyalty to abstract principles, notably the law and contractual obligations. Kinsmen may be obliged to help each other because of a “personal” connection, whereas bureaucrats have committed themselves to follow identical procedures and principles no matter who they are dealing with. Justice is blind – as is equality. And yet, even in the latter camp, we can find the language of kinship, e.g., constitutional “patriotism.” We will examine these issues through two lenses: (i) the relationship between “the individual” and “the collectivity” and (ii) the relationship between “tradition” and “modernity.”

Food is ‘hot’ at the present, as few topics elicit such fascination, dialogue, activism, or tension as food and agriculture. This course will begin studying food and society through a Micro-sociological perspective, “Food and Identity”, “Food and Spectacle. ”  And it moves to larger scale to examine and agrifood system which is dominant in the globe--- its design, function, dysfunction, and possibility. Then, it extends to topics related to China: the food system transaction and China’s food safety problem, to discuss food futures including AFNS, GMOS, and nano food in globalization. This course is designed to embed students in the historical origins of the agrifood system as well as to expose them to the major trends taking place, along with the primary concepts and theories used to explain agrifood structure and social change.

Course Title: Women in Twentieth-Century China: a Social History
Course Unit: 3
Course Description: What role have women played in the history of modern China? What is the relationship between women and men in China since the late Qing dynasty and how does that affect our interpretations of China’ long twentieth Century? This course examines modern and contemporary Chinese history through the lens of women and gender. The history of modern China was a political history written by reformers, revolutionists and left-wing intellectuals; a cultural history of booming publishing houses and education institutions; a social history of professionals, workers, beggars and refugees. While men were the leaders throughout, women were also an important part. Examining women in history of twentieth-century China is thus another perspective to view general political and social change as well as everyday life of ordinary people in Chinese society. The course will introduce students to historical periods central to women in different classes, area and marital status. The discussion of primary sources, such as newspapers, magazines, memoirs, photographs and posters will allow participants to gain familiarity with different kinds of primary sources including printed and oral, textual and visual, and with the theories and methodologies relevant to studying this history.

Course Title: Audiocvisual Criticism through Moview Making
Course Unit: 3
Course Description: This course is a practical and theoretical investigation into how to “write with video” about audiovisual media. Traditionally, media criticism and scholarship has assumed a written form and therefore faced the difficulty of translating the images and sounds of its original object into words. But with the explosion of digital platforms for distributing videos online and easily accessible equipment, critics are increasingly able to present their insights directly—to show with the work itself rather than tell through description. The course examines audiovisual media in two senses: as a topic of critical reflection and as a mode of presentation. It introduces students to the traditional concerns of media criticism, such as interpretation, evaluation, formal analysis, and socio-political reflection, and situates them in contemporary media industries and their surrounding discourses. It examines rhetorical strategies for conveying original thoughts about film and media texts—both verbally and audiovisually. Like the written essay, video form creates its own challenges, including how to select materials and combine them with voice-over, text, music, visual effects, or other video techniques. Students will view and evaluate examples of this mode of criticism and work from those models to construct their own analyses and interpretations of film, television, or any other media works. Lectures will sharpen our attention to aspects of media to consider for sophisticated criticism to be assessed in a mid-term essay. In tutorial sessions, we will learn basic skills in videomaking, including using Adobe Premiere Pro, which students will use to complete several short, very simple video assignments. The course will culminate in a final assignment in which each student will create an original audiovisual essay on a media-related topic that interests them.

Course Title: In Dialogue With Nature
Course Unit: 3
Course Description: Humans have long been curious about Nature. In the West, ancient Greek philosophers took the lead in exploring the physical world and the world of life with reason and hence laid the foundations of modern science. Scientists discovered physical laws, the laws governing life and even ways of controlling life. Implications of these discoveries force the humankind to re-assess their understanding of human understanding. On the oriental side of the globe, Chinese philosophers developed a different view of Nature. The comparison between Western and Chinese views will contribute to our understanding of both. This course invites students to explore how the humankind investigated, understood and changed Nature, to study and compare the development of science in Western and Chinese cultures, and to reflect on the humans’ place in Nature. Students will be required to read, discuss and write about a wide range of texts in philosophy, science and its history. Reading materials will be selected from influential literatures. Emphasis will be placed on students’ capacity to respond critically to these texts in written as well as oral presentations.

Although, these questions have been addressed in a large body of research – key findings elude most people in leadership positions. This is evidenced by a global survey of employee attitudes toward management suggesting 82% of people do not trust their boss and over 50% of employees quit their job because of their managers (HBR, 2016).  Leadership is viewed as “one of the most observed and least understood phenomena on earth” (James Burns). The primary reason is that leadership is multifaceted, complex and contextually driven. The purpose of this course is to help you make sense of the leadership phenomena and apply this understanding to your own life-long leadership journey. The Leadership Development course will cover three areas that provide relevant knowledge for developing effective leaders: overview of leadership, individual skills development, and relationships building. The overview will cover leadership definition and important research perspectives. The individual skills includes mind, emotions, courage, moral leadership and followership. The relationships building focuses on motivation, communication, teams and influence. We will learn about these topics in a practical manner through the use of cases, assessments, and leadership examples. The course will be a combination of assessments, case study and analysis, lecture, small group work and presentations. You are highly encouraged to share your own relevant professional and personal leadership experiences. The class is interactive and significant participation in discussion is expected in order to reap the full benefits. It is critical that you take responsibility and ownership of your leadership development. In sum, there is a global shortage of competent leadership. This course will prepare you to better understand the complexity and challenges of developing yourself and others as effective leaders from both an individual and relational perspective.
